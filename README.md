## Introduction to Blindstore

[Blindstore](https://blindstore.github.io/) is a private information retrieval data store.
It provides an online lookup service which returns the correct answer without ever knowing what the question was.

This is an ongoing effort to implement Blindstore in C++ based on the V-DGHV scheme of somewhat homomorphic encryption presented in [1].
It is not yet finished.
For a working proof of concept of the Blindstore concept, please see the [blindstore-old-scarab repository](https://github.com/blindstore/blindstore-old-scarab).
The implementation there is based on another encryption scheme.
